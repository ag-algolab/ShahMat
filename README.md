**ShahMat** is a Python package that leverages the official [Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) to **fetch, analyze, and visualize your games**.  
It is part of the **AG Algo Lab** initiative: making finance & tech accessible to everyone — and yes, sometimes we have fun applying data science to chess too!

The name *ShahMat* comes from the ancient expression that later gave birth to the word **“checkmate”** :)
